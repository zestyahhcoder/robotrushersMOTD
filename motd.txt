Hello Robots, we have finished building the Level 1 Chase lab, we currently have Bennett in his test tube but Rob has been released into the first level, we have increased scale to maximize enjoyability, although we have released Rob into a new place, we have a feeling he is smarter than we think and may find a way to escape. This is the only update as of now, join the discord to give suggestions.
