 It's Thanksgiving time in Robot Rushers! Go get yourself some thanksgiving and turkey themed cosmetics with the new PlayFab operated system! Looks like there was some turkeys that have fallen from the sky, and Rob seems to have disappeared. He's still a little sketch though. Something has happened to the Virtual Vision shop. Not even Spencer noticed it. Screws have been reset, so make sure you tell me how many screws you had. I know if you're lying as well. Anyways enjoy the holidays and get your cosmetics before Christmas.
