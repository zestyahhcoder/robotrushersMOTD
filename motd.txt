Things tend to get scary at this time of year, check out new cosmetics to go trick or treating! Rob seems to be gone, but you may feel his presence. If you do, be completely still and make sure he cant detect your location. There's some new music made for this spooky time, its still the same melody, but with some alterations. Have fun!
