Hello Robots, we have finished building the Level 1 Chase lab, we currently have Bennett in his test tube but Rob has been released into the first level, we have increased scale to maximize enjoyability, although we have released Rob into a new place, we have a feeling he is smarter than we think and may find a way to escape. We have also included a new purchasable! It is slip skis, everytime you join, you must click the button to make them work, or else they will only be cosmetic. Join the discord to give suggestions. There has also been a bug fix for horror and changing maps, make sure to let me know of any bugs!
