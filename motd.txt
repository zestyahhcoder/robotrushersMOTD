Hello there Robots! This new update to Robot Rushers brings a few new things, firstly, you can no longer escape the maps. But there is some more important stuff. There are 2 changes to the world of Robot Rushers. The original caves map has returned, and its still the same as before. Another major update to the map is the horror mode. Rob has more space to run now, so he's faster. Have fun running away from him! His friends aren't far from us.
