A new update is out! This update brings bug fixes and new music in the game! If you don't like it or don't feel like listening to it, you can mute it at the old radio in the main map. If you worry that it will play when you rejoin the game, it wont, it stays muted forever unless you chose to unmute it, and vice versa. This update also fixes a bug for you horror enjoyers. You no longer fall through the map and get kicked out when getting jumpscared, that bug has been fixed!
