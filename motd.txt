The robots have found their way out of the cave! When they reached the surface, they found a new world for them to find their way around. The world seems new, and untouched, Spencer has set up some shops already! And there's a snowy mountain for you Robots to play in. The cave we've seen before has came back, and is brighter than ever. Trees in the plains are nowhere to be seen, you all might need to be a part of turning the plain terrain into a beautiful forest!
