Hello there Robots, the world of Robot Rushers has experienced a world reset, do not mind your summon location, its just the lab, to get to maps, you now use keycards, we have been able to contain the subjects dubbed as Rob and Benett, but they will likely escape within the next few months, a lot of you subjec- I mean Robots enjoy being chased by the subjects, so soon the Tech Lab will open up a Chase Simulation, like before but controlled. Also, cosmetics are now free for all, at least almost all of them. You will have free cosmetics and will pay with real world currency for others. Have fun, enjoy the new  scenery.
