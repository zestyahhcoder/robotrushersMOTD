Hello there Robots, Rob and Bennett have been contained in test tubes out of reach from you robots since the reality reset, but onoe of you decided to try to free them, they failed, but it seems like they will end up getting released into the main map at around.. October, we are trying everything we can to stop it from happening, but it may be inevitable. We are working on creating the chase lab for you robots, by the way, have  you deciphered the secret message held by the red robot in plains? Since its old news, we have also removed the news channel from your spawn location. You all have found it quite annoying.
